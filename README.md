# DOUBLY LINKED LIST

This repository is my own implementation of a **templated doubly-linked-list** using the C++ language. This template include basic operations on linked-list such as creation, insertion, modification, and deletion of nodes. Moreover, this template also includes a customized iterator class inclusively for the list class. The iterator class contains various overloaded operators such as ==, !=, =, ++, --, etc. 

## FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS FOR LIST CLASS

### OVERLOADED OPERATORS
> The comparision operators are based on **_lexicographical_** comparison.
> * operator=
> * operator==
> * operator!=
> * operator>
> * operator>=
> * operator<
> * operator<=

### OPERATION FUNCTIONS

> INSERTION / ASSIGNMENT OPERATIONS
> * push_front
> * push_back
> * insert // single insertion
> * insert // multiple insertion
> * assign // single assignment
> * assign // multiple assignment
> * merge

> DELETION / REMOVAL OPERATIONS
> * pop_front
> * pop_back
> * splice // whole list
> * splice // from specfied beginning upto the last node
> * splice // from specfied beginning upto specified end
> * erase // single deletion
> * erase // multiple deletion
> * clear

> ARRANGEMENT OPERATIONS
> * reverse
> * sort

> UTILITY FUNCTIONS
> * size
> * front
> * back
> * begin
> * end
