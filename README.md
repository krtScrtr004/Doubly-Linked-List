# DOUBLY LINKED LIST

This repository is my own implementation of a **templated doubly-linked-list** using the C++ language. This implementation is prior to utilization of std::list, so some operations may not be identical to that of from the said container. This template include basic operations on linked-list such as creation, insertion, modification, and deletion of nodes. Moreover, this template also includes a customized iterator class inclusively for the list class. The iterator class contains various overloaded operators such as ==, !=, =, ++, --, etc.
